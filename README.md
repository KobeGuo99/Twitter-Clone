This project is a clone of Twitter that mimics the functionality of Twitter. 

I used Next.js and React for front-end, and Firebase for back-end services like user authentication and real-time data updates. Leveraged Redux for predictable state management and Tailwind CSS for responsive UI, ensuring a robust, secure, and user-friendly application.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
